A better performing result can be obtained with the following simpler input:

  opes: OPES_WT ARG=phi1,phi2,phi3,psi1,psi2,psi3 PACE=50 BARRIER=50

but it was not used, to have a more fair comparison with standard metadynamics ala2 simulations.
(if not set, SIGMA is chosen adaptively, similarly to METAD ADAPTIVE=DIFF)
