Notice that the OPES_METAD simulation will sensibly slow down as time passes, due to the great number of kernels needed in 6D.
This is even more noticeable since the system is small and most of the computation is done by PLUMED. It also runs on a single core, thus the the kernels summation cannot be parallelized.
In the TODO list is to add a neighbor list, to avoid this issue.
In the meantime one can play around, e.g. stop the simulation if the system is diffusive and use a static bias (restart with huge PACE) or restart with FIXED_SIGMA, or increase the COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD.
